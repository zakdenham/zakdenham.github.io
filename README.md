Social media, websites, and digital identities are synthetic representations of our vibrant selves. Wouldn’t it be bizarre for one’s online persona to be more stimulating than them in-person? 
Yeah, that’d be weird.

What if the opposite were true? What if a website (digital business card, portfolio, etc.) gave you the minimum necessary information and prioritized connecting with someone directly?

If you’ve found this site, I’d bet it’d be better for us to connect face-to-face, or at least over a call/Zoom/etc. I prefer to share my skills, personality, and perspectives with you in a more meaningful –dare I say– more respectful way. Catered photos and bullshit verbiage trying to convince you of my/my work’s worth is something I’d rather not fuck with. 

Want to connect?

Or, if you wait long enough at your local specialty coffee shop (e.g. [Crema](https://crema-coffee.com)), I’ll be there in a black shirt.
